# Assignment 8

## Plotting

## Overview
In this assignment, we are using Python's Seaborn library to visualize and analyze a dataset containing information about students, including their study time, grades, courses, gender, and more. Each exercise involves creating a specific type of plot to gain insights from the data.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Create a lineplot showing how Study Time varies by Student Name. Which student has the highest study time?
**Description:** We are plotting a line to show how much time each student spends studying.

### Exercise 2: Plot a histogram (histplot) of Grade and determine which grade range has the highest frequency of students.
**Description:** We are creating a bar chart to see how many students fall into each grade range.

### Exercise 3: Create an ECDF plot (ecdfplot) for Grade. What is the percentage of students scoring less than 85?
**Description:** We are plotting cumulative percentages of grades and calculating the percentage of students with grades below 85.

### Exercise 4: Create a stripplot showing Grade distribution for each Course. Which course has the most spread in grades?
**Description:** We are plotting individual grades for each course to see their spread.

### Exercise 5: Create a swarmplot to show the relationship between Gender and Study Time. Which gender has a higher average study time?
**Description:** We are showing the distribution of study times for males and females.

### Exercise 6: Plot a pointplot to show the average Grade for each Course. Which course has the highest average grade?
**Description:** We are plotting the average grade for each course to compare performance.
