## Pandas II

## Overview
This assignment focuses on performing various DataFrame manipulations using Python's **pandas** library. It includes tasks like creating new columns, merging DataFrames, and extracting specific information from text columns. These exercises are designed to improve your data preprocessing and transformation skills.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Creating Professor Initials
**Description:** We need to extract the initials of each professor's first and last names and store them in a new column called professor_initials.


### Exercise 2: Given the dataframe below. Use **join** to combine this new DataFrame with the original one based on the professor column.
**Description:** We will merge the original DataFrame and the new df_courses DataFrame using the professor column as the key.

### Exercise 3: Combine the original df and df_courses DataFrames.
**Description:** We combine two DataFrames (df and df_courses) based on the common column professor to include the course information for each professor.

### Exercise 4: In the professor column, create a new column professor_last_name by extracting the last name of each professor using string operations.
**Description:** We extract the last name of each professor from the professor column using string operations and store it in a new column called professor_last_name.
