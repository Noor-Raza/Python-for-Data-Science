        "- **Course Class**: Represents a course with a name, description, and methods to manage enrolled students.\n",
        "  - Add and remove students from the course.\n",
        "  - Display all students enrolled in the course.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Student Class**: Represents a student with a name, ID number, address, and a list of enrolled courses.\n",
        "  - Enroll in and drop courses.\n",
        "  - Assign grades for each course and calculate the Grade Point Average (GPA).\n",
        "  - Display all registered courses and their grades.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Registration Class**: Manages the overall registration process, including a list of students and courses.\n",
        "  - Enroll students in courses and drop courses.\n",
        "  - Display all available courses and registered students.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Exercises Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Course Class**: Implement a class to manage course details and student enrollments.\n",
        "2. **Student Class**: Create a class to manage student information, course enrollments, and grades.\n",
        "3. **Registration Class**: Develop a central management class that oversees both courses and students.\n",
        "4. **GPA Calculation**: Enhance the Student class to include grade assignments and a method to calculate GPA based on enrolled courses.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Usage\n",
        "The system allows you to create instances of students and courses, manage enrollments, and calculate GPAs. Example usage is provided to demonstrate the functionalities of the classes."
